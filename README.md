## My Favourite Movie Series
1. Fast and Furious - Movie about fast cars.
2. Bridget Jones - Bridget Jones is certainly filled with charm and intrigue.
3. Child's Play - pop-out scares, blood, and slasher tropes.
4. Harry Potter - It's levi-oh-sa, not levio-sahh.
5. James Bond - The James Bond saga has a loyal, devout following no matter what actor is playing 007.
